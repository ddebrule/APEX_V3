AGR TIRE MATRIX (JCONCEPTS):
- GREEN COMPOUND (Super Soft): Use for morning practice or damp/freshly watered tracks.
- BLUE COMPOUND (Firm): The "Main Event" tire when track temps exceed 90°F.
- TREAD PATTERN: 
  * Reflex: Best for forward bite on fresh water.
  * Detox: Best for longevity and "sweeping" dusty lines.
  * Rehab: Preferred for high-wear, abrasive blue-groove surfaces.
- INSERTS: Dirt Tech (Gray) is the standard. Use "Thin" inserts for extremely bumpy/rutted conditions to allow the tire to conform.
