# ⚠️ FIRST STEP: Install Node.js

Before we can run the Conversational Advisor, you need to install Node.js (which includes npm).

---

## 🚨 Current Status

❌ **Node.js is not installed on your system**

This is why `npm install` can't run. But it's a quick fix!

---

## ✅ How to Install Node.js

### Option 1: Official Installer (Easiest) 🎯

1. **Go to:** https://nodejs.org/
2. **Download:** "LTS" version (the big green button)
3. **Run the installer**
4. **Click "Next" through all screens** (defaults are fine)
5. **Finish**

**That's it!** Node.js and npm are now installed.

### Option 2: Using Chocolatey (If you have it)

```powershell
choco install nodejs
```

### Option 3: Using Windows Package Manager

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Installation

After installing, **open a NEW terminal/command prompt** and run:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers like:
```
v20.10.0
10.2.3
```

If you see versions → **✅ You're ready!**

## 📋 What Gets Installed

When you install Node.js, you get:
- **Node** – JavaScript runtime
- **npm** – Package manager (like app store for code)
- **npx** – Command runner

This allows you to run web development tools.

---

## ⏱️ How Long?

- Download: 2-5 minutes (depending on internet)
- Install: 1-2 minutes
- Verify: 1 minute

**Total: 5-10 minutes**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Installing

Once Node.js is installed:

1. **Close this documentation**
2. **Close any terminals** (if they're open)
3. **Open a NEW terminal** (so it picks up Node.js installation)
4. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
   ```
   cd "c:\Users\dnyce\Desktop\Coding\Antigravit Workspaces\APEX_V3\Execution\frontend"
   ```
5. **Run the app:**
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
6. **Visit:** http://localhost:3000

## ✨ Once Node.js is Installed

I can do these terminal commands for you:
- ✅ `npm install` – Download all dependencies
- ✅ `npm run dev` – Start the development server
- ✅ `npm run build` – Build for production
- ✅ `npm run type-check` – Check for TypeScript errors

Just **install Node.js first**, then come back here and I'll handle the rest!

---

## 🎓 Why Node.js?

The app is built with:
- React (JavaScript library)
- Next.js (web framework)
- npm (manages dependencies)

All of these require Node.js to run.

It's like:
- Python development needs Python installed
- Java development needs Java installed
- JavaScript web development needs Node.js installed

---

## ⚡ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Downloaded Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- [ ] Ran the installer (clicked through screens)
- [ ] Restarted your computer (or closed all terminals)
- [ ] Opened a NEW terminal
- [ ] Ran `node --version` and saw a version number
- [ ] Ran `npm --version` and saw a version number

**If all checked ✅:** You're ready! Come back here and I'll do the rest.

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "node command not found" | Close terminal and open a NEW one |
| Installer won't run | Disable antivirus temporarily, try again |
| Installation fails | Try Option 2 or 3 above (Chocolatey/winget) |
| Can't find installer | Go to https://nodejs.org/ → download "LTS" |

---

## 📞 When You're Done Installing

Once Node.js is installed with `node --version` working:

1. Let me know
2. I'll run all the terminal commands for you
3. App will be running at http://localhost:3000
4. You can test the Conversational Advisor

---

**Go install Node.js now, then come back!** 🚀

It's the only manual step needed. Everything after that, I can do for you.
