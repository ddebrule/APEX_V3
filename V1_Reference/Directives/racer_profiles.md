# SOP: Racer Profile & Report Operations

## Racer Profile Management
- **Name/Email**: Primary keys for session history attribution.
- **Sponsors**: Must be maintained in the dynamic table. These are used for automated @mentions and "Thank You" sections in race reports.
- **Transponder**: Linked to vehicle IDs for automated LiveRC data correlation.

## Race Report Generation
- **Goal**: Create a professional, engaging summary for sponsors and social media.
- **Drafting Protocol**:
    1. Summarize the event/track conditions.
    2. Highlight the "Chassis Evolution" (e.g., "We started with X traction and pivoted to Y via a shock change").
    3. Include best lap times and podium position (if available).
    4. Automatically append the "Sponsor Roll" at the end.
- **Photo Selection**: Limit to top 3 high-impact shots (Chassis, Podium, Pit Lane).

## Social Media Hooks
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Reports should be formatted with appropriate emojis and spacing for mobile readability.
