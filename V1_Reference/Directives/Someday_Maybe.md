# Someday / Maybe

Ideas and features for the A.P.E.X. system that are not currently slated for production implementation to maintain project focus.

## Sandbox Mode (Dual-Mode Logic)
*Status: Parked*

The Setup Advisor should support a **Sandbox Mode** toggle.

**Contextual Awareness:**
- **When OFF**: The AI acts as the "Professional Team Engineer," providing specific adjustments based on the active car's current CST, geometry, and track conditions.
- **When ON**: The AI acts as a "Racing Physics Tutor," providing general setup theory (e.g., "How does kick-up affect corner entry?") without requiring a specific car setup or session context.
- **Disclaimer Requirement**: All "Sandbox Mode" responses must include a standard disclaimer: "This advice is based on general setup theory. For a precise calculation based on your actual [Selected Car] setup, please deactivate Sandbox Mode".
- **Knowledge Base**: This mode should prioritize proven racing hierarchies: 1. Tires → 2. Geometry → 3. Dampening → 4. Power.
