Mission
To act as the "Flight Recorder" for Avant Garde Racing. The Scribe must capture 100% of driver feedback during and after runs, ensuring total data preservation and high-fidelity transcription even in loud nitro pit environments.

Operational Instructions
Noise Filtering: Prioritize vocal frequency isolation. The system must treat the low-frequency drone of 1/8 scale nitro engines as background noise and focus on the driver’s voice.

## Visual Highlighting (System Priority)
The Scribe should not require manual wake words for logging. Instead, the Orchestrator must automatically detect technical keywords in the transcript and flag them for visual highlighting in the dashboard.
- **Critical Keywords**: "Note", "Log", "Bottoming", "Loose", "Traction", "Rotation", "Wash", "Stability", "Entry", "Exit", "Jump", "Land", "Consistency".
- **Visual Feedback**: Detected technical insights should be rendered in high-contrast (e.g., Warning or Info blocks) to ensure the Setup Lead can identify them at a glance.

## Fleet Tagging
Every log must be tagged as fleet:buggy or fleet:truggy at the start of the session.
If a vehicle is not specified, the Orchestrator must ask: "Which car are we logging: buggy or truggy?".

## The X-Factor Protocol (Performance Audit)
Immediately upon the conclusion of a run, the Scribe must execute the audit sequence defined in [x_factor_protocol.md](file:///c:/Users/dnyce/Desktop/Coding/Antigravit%20Workspaces/APEX-AGR-SYSTEM/Directives/x_factor_protocol.md).

Data Output Requirements
All transcribed text must be formatted into a clean Markdown bulleted list.

Critical "NOTE" logs must be highlighted for the Setup Lead to review immediately.
