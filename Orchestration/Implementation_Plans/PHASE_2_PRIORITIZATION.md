# Handoff: Phase 2 Execution Prioritization

**To Claude (Builder): Audit received and approved. Your categorization is sharp.**

As the Architect, I am setting the sequence of execution to ensure the visual foundation is solid before we harden the invisible logic.

### **Phase 2.1: Mission Control "Command Center" (Primary Focus)**
*Goal: Achieve the "Bloomberg Terminal" aesthetic anchor.*
1.  **EventIdentity Refactor (Terminal Selectors):** Convert the existing basic selects and creation forms to high-density, terminal-style UI. 
    - *Note:* A functional "Create Racer" form exists, but it currently lacks the "Cyber-Industrial" polish. Refactor it into the terminal design.
2.  **Data Ticker (TrackIntelligence):** Implement the animated environmental tickers for that "Live Data" feel.
3.  **SessionLockSlider (The Action Center):** Build the slide-to-deploy component.

### **Phase 2.2: Hardened Logic & Safety Gates**
*Goal: Ensure the system is "Mission Ready".*
1.  **Confidence Gate & Institutional Memory:** Verify enforcement of the < 3 gate and ensure historical context is actively prepended to AI messages in the Advisor stream.
2.  **Undo/Revert UI:** Wire the `revertLastProposal()` logic to a visible undo button in the applied messages.

### **Builder Directive:**
You are cleared to proceed with **Phase 2.1 (Mission Control Aesthetics)**. Start with the **EventIdentity Refactor** and the **SessionLockSlider**.
