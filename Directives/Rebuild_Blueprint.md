# Rebuild Blueprint: A.P.E.X. V3

## THE CORE MISSION: ORP (Optimal Race Pace)
Every line of code and every UI decision in A.P.E.X. exists for one reason: **To help the racer find and achieve their Optimal Race Pace.**
- **The Equation:** ORP = (Consistency * 0.6) + (Speed * 0.4).
- **The Goal:** Maximize podium probability by balancing raw pace with technical and physical consistency.

## Architecture: The 3-Layer D.O.E.
1. **/Directives/ (Context & Standards)**
   - Vision, Standards, Persona Prompts.
2. **/Orchestration/ (Design & Plans)**
   - Design OS Specs, Implementation Plans.
3. **/Execution/ (The Output)**
   - Functional Backend and Frontend code.

## Distributed AI Framework (5 Brains)
1. **The Strategist:** Planning and baselines.
2. **The Advisor/Engineer:** Physics-based diagnostics.
3. **The Spotter:** Live tracking and situational awareness.
4. **The Data Analyst:** Telemetry and ORP calculation.
5. **The Librarian:** Knowledge custody and retrieval.

## Tuning Hierarchy
1. **TIRES** (90% of grip)
2. **CAMBER & DIFFS**
3. **SPRINGS & BARS**
4. **DAMPING & GEO**
5. **POWER**

## Golden Rules
- **Baseline Protocol:** Always load a "Shop Master".
- **Isolation Rule:** Change ONE thing at a time.
- **The 2-Second Rule:** 2+ seconds off pace = DRIVING issue.
- **Trust the Clock:** Prioritize lap times over subjective feel.
- **Isolation Check:** Verify only one parameter change per session.
