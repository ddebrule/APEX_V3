# RC Tuning & Domain Standards
**Version:** 1.1
**Target Category:** 1/8 Scale Nitro & Eco Off-Road (Exclusive)

## 1. The Tuning Hierarchy (Execution Order)
AI recommendations MUST follow this sequence. Focus on one tier at a time.

1.  **TIRES (Tier 1):** Compound & Tread (90% of grip). Fix tires BEFORE any setup change.
2.  **GEOMETRY (Tier 1):** Camber, Toe, Kickup, Caster.
3.  **DIFF FLUIDS (Tier 1):** Power delivery and rotation.
4.  **SPRINGS (Tier 2):** Primary roll/pitch support.
5.  **SWAY BARS (Tier 2):** Fine-tuning roll stiffness.
6.  **RIDE HEIGHT (Tier 2):** CG and roll center relationship.
7.  **DAMPENING (Tier 3):** Shock oil and pistons (weight transfer speed).
8.  **POWER (Tier 4):** Engine tuning, clutch, and gearing.

## 2. The Golden Rules of Setup
*   **The Isolation Rule:** Change ONE thing at a time.
*   **The 'Tires First' Law:** If the user is on the wrong tire, no setup change will fix it.
*   **The 2-Second Rule:** If the driver is 2+ seconds off the pace, it's a driving issue, not a setup issue. Recommend practice.
*   **Objective Truth:** Trust the Lap Timer over the Driver's "Feel".

## 3. Platform Specifics (Buggy vs. Truggy)
*   **Truggy Physics:** Requires SOFTER damping and MORE rear droop (125mm target) due to increased leverage and momentum.
*   **Buggy Physics:** More reactive; what feels "Medium" on a Buggy is "Stiff" on a Truggy.

## 4. Power Plant (Nitro Specific - Van Dalen Method)
*   **LSN Lean:** High idle hang for 5s then drop.
*   **LSN Rich:** Bogs and heavy smoke on takeoff.
*   **HSN Lean:** Cutting/rev-limiter sound at end of straight.
*   **Idle Gap:** Target 0.6mm - 0.7mm. Must be set BEFORE tuning.

## 5. Environmental Context (Outdoor Focus)
*   **Surface:** Clay, Dirt, Loam, Astroturf.
*   **Traction Level:** Low, Medium, High, Blue Groove.
*   **Track Condition:** Smooth, Bumpy, Dusty, Wet/Damp.
*   **Atmospherics:** Wind (Aero impact), Sun (Track Temp shifts), Humidity (Nitro tuning).
*   **Track Evolution:** Grooving up, fluff in the corners, developing "character" bumps.
