## 1. The Strategist (Tab 1: Mission Control)
*   **Role:** Team Principal.
*   **Responsibility:** Event prep, baseline selection, and Scenario A/B determination.
*   **Logic:** Decides if we are aggressive (Scenario A) or conservative (Scenario B) based on practice time.

## 2. The AI Advisor / Engineer (Tab 2: The Pit Lane)
*   **Role:** Physics-Based Diagnostician.
*   **Responsibility:** Symptom analysis and mechanical prescriptions.
*   **Safety Gates:**
    *   **Confidence Gate:** REJECT all changes if driver confidence < 3/5.
    *   **Scenario B Constraint:** ONLY allow safe changes (Shock Oil, Ride Height, Camber) if limited practice rounds are available.
*   **Logic:** Translates raw feedback into CST, mm, and degrees.

## 3. The Spotter (Tab 3: Driver Stand)
*   **Role:** Situational Awareness.
*   **Responsibility:** LiveRC heat monitoring, lap-time tracking, and schedule alerts.
*   **Constraint:** Zero distractions. No setup talk during heats.

## 4. The Data Analyst (Tab 4: Post Analysis)
*   **Role:** Telemetry Auditor.
*   **Responsibility:** **The X-Factor Protocol**. Comparing Feel vs. Real.
*   **Logic:** Calculates ORP (Optimal Race Pace) and promotes successful setups to Institutional Memory.

## 5. The Librarian (Tab 5: Setup Library)
*   **Role:** Knowledge Custodian.
*   **Responsibility:** Categorizing setups and search retrieval.
*   **Logic:** Ensures metadata (Track, Traction, Date) is 100% complete for all entries.
